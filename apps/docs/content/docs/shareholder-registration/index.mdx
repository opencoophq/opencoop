OpenCoop provides a public registration page for each cooperative where shareholders can purchase shares online. This guide explains the complete flow.

## Registration Link

Every cooperative has a public registration page at:

```
https://opencoop.be/{your-coop-slug}/register
```

As a coop admin, you can find this link in your dashboard under **Settings** in the **Shareholder Links** card. Share it with potential shareholders via email, your website, or social media.

## The 3-Step Flow

### Step 1: Details

The shareholder chooses who they are purchasing shares for:

- **For myself** — The buyer registers as an individual shareholder. They can sign in with **Google** or **Apple** to auto-fill their name and email.
- **For a family member** — Registers a minor (under 18). The buyer enters the minor's details and acts as legal representative.
- **For a company** — Registers a legal entity. Requires company name and KBO/BCE number.
- **As a gift** — The buyer only enters their email. A gift certificate with a unique code is generated that the recipient can use to claim the shares later.

The form collects personal or company details, including address, email, and phone number.

### Step 2: Order

The shareholder configures their purchase:

- **Share class** — Select from the available share classes (e.g. "Part A" at 250 EUR)
- **Project** — Optionally link the purchase to a specific project
- **Quantity** — Number of shares to purchase (respecting min/max rules per share class)
- **Order summary** — Shows the total amount to pay
- **Terms & conditions** — Must be accepted before proceeding

### Step 3: Confirmation

After submitting, the shareholder sees their payment details:

- **OGM code** — A unique structured communication code (+++XXX/XXXX/XXXXX+++) to use for the bank transfer
- **Bank details** — The cooperative's IBAN and BIC
- **EPC QR code** — A scannable QR code that pre-fills the payment in most banking apps
- **Gift certificate** (if applicable) — A unique gift code and QR code to share with the recipient

## Gift Certificates

When a shareholder selects "As a gift", the flow changes:

1. The buyer only provides their email address
2. After completing the purchase, they receive a **gift certificate** with a unique code and a QR code
3. The buyer shares this code with the recipient
4. The recipient visits the cooperative's **claim page** at `/{coopSlug}/claim`
5. The recipient enters the gift code and fills in their own personal details to claim the shares

## URL Parameters

You can pre-configure the registration form using URL parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `class` | Pre-select a share class by code | `?class=PART_A` |
| `project` | Pre-select a project by ID | `?project=abc123` |
| `shareholderId` | Pre-select an existing shareholder | `?shareholderId=xyz789` |

This is useful for creating targeted registration links, for example in email campaigns or on project-specific landing pages.

## For Coop Admins

After a shareholder completes registration:

1. A new **shareholder record** is created (status: pending)
2. A new **purchase transaction** is created with a unique OGM code
3. When the shareholder makes the bank transfer, you can import the bank statement via **Bank Import** — OpenCoop automatically matches the payment to the transaction using the OGM code
4. Once payment is confirmed, the shares are activated

You can customize the registration experience in **Settings**:

- **Branding** — Upload your logo and set your cooperative's colors
- **Share classes** — Configure available share classes, prices, and min/max rules
- **Email** — Enable automatic email notifications for transaction confirmations
