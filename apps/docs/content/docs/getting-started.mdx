This guide walks you through setting up your cooperative on OpenCoop.

## 1. Create Your Account

Visit [opencoop.be](https://opencoop.be) and click **Get started**. Choose a plan that fits your cooperative and complete the onboarding form:

- **Cooperative name** — The official name of your cooperative
- **Slug** — A URL-friendly identifier (e.g. `my-coop`) used in your public page URL
- **Your details** — Name and email address for the admin account

You'll receive a confirmation email to verify your account.

## 2. Configure Your Cooperative

Once logged in, navigate to **Settings** in the admin sidebar to configure:

- **Branding** — Upload your logo and set your cooperative's colors
- **Share classes** — Define one or more share classes with prices and rules
- **Email settings** — Enable automatic emails for transaction confirmations and shareholder notifications
- **Bank account** — Add your cooperative's IBAN for payment matching

## 3. Add Shareholders

Go to **Shareholders** and click **Add Shareholder**. You can register three types:

- **Individual** — A natural person
- **Company** — A legal entity (requires KBO/BCE number)
- **Minor** — A person under 18 (requires a legal representative)

## 4. Process Transactions

Navigate to **Transactions** to record share purchases, sales, and transfers. Each transaction generates:

- A unique **OGM code** (structured communication) for payment tracking
- An automatic email notification to the shareholder (if enabled)
- A PDF confirmation document
