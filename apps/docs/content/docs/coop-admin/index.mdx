This guide covers the administrative features available to coop admins in OpenCoop.

## Dashboard Overview

The admin dashboard gives you a bird's-eye view of your cooperative:

- **Total shareholders** and active shareholders count
- **Total capital** raised across all share classes
- **Pending transactions** that need approval or payment
- **Recent activity** feed showing the latest changes

## Managing Shareholders

### Viewing Shareholders

The **Shareholders** page shows all registered shareholders in a searchable, sortable table. You can filter by status (active, pending, inactive) and type (individual, company, minor).

### Adding a Shareholder

Click **Add Shareholder** and fill in the required information:

- **Type** — Individual, Company, or Minor
- **Personal details** — Name, email, address, national register number
- **Company details** (if applicable) — Company name, KBO/BCE number, VAT number
- **Legal representative** (for minors) — Name and relationship

### Editing Shareholders

Click on any shareholder to view their full profile. From there you can update their details, view their share portfolio, and see their transaction history.

## Managing Share Classes

Navigate to **Share Classes** to configure the types of shares your cooperative offers:

- **Name** — A descriptive name (e.g. "Part A", "Part B")
- **Nominal value** — The price per share
- **Minimum shares** — Minimum number of shares a shareholder must hold
- **Maximum shares** — Maximum number of shares per shareholder (optional)

## Processing Transactions

### Approving Transactions

When shareholders submit a purchase or sale request, it appears as a pending transaction. Review the details and:

1. **Approve** — Confirm the transaction and generate the OGM payment code
2. **Reject** — Decline the transaction with an optional reason

### Payment Tracking

Each approved purchase transaction gets a unique OGM code (+++XXX/XXXX/XXXXX+++). When you import bank statements, OpenCoop automatically matches payments to transactions using these codes.

### Bank Import

Go to **Bank Import** to upload CODA or CSV files from your bank. OpenCoop will:

1. Parse all incoming transactions
2. Match them to pending payments via OGM codes
3. Show unmatched transactions for manual review

## Dividends

Navigate to **Dividends** to manage dividend distributions:

1. **Create a dividend round** — Set the fiscal year and amount per share
2. **Calculate** — OpenCoop computes each shareholder's dividend, including Belgian withholding tax (30%)
3. **Approve and distribute** — Generate dividend statements and tax documents

## Reports

The **Reports** section provides exportable data:

- Shareholder register (PDF/CSV)
- Transaction overview
- Capital overview by share class
- Dividend distribution reports

## Settings

In **Settings** you can manage:

- **General** — Cooperative name, slug, contact details
- **Branding** — Logo, primary color, custom email templates
- **Email** — SMTP configuration and notification preferences
- **Bank account** — IBAN and BIC for payment matching
